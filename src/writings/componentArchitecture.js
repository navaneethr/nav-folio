const text = "In my perspective, React Component Architecture is the cornerstone of creating digital poetry. Each component is a carefully crafted stanza, contributing to the symphony of user interface. It's not just about organizing code; it's an art form, a meticulous arrangement that balances functionality and elegance. My approach involves creating a modular structure that fosters reusability, maintainability, and a seamless user experience. Every component has a purpose, and the architecture is a narrative that unfolds beautifully with user interaction.";
