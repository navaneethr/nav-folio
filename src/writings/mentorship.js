const text = "As a mentor in Software Development, my perspective revolves around cultivating a symbiotic relationship of growth and learning. Mentorship isn't a one-way street; it's a shared journey of exploration and development. I focus on guiding aspiring developers not just through technical challenges but also nurturing their soft skills and instilling a sense of curiosity and adaptability. It's about creating a supportive environment where questions are welcomed, mistakes are learning opportunities, and success is a collaborative achievement. My approach involves leading with empathy, understanding individual strengths, and fostering a mentorship dynamic that propels both mentor and mentee towards continuous improvement.";
